## TODO LIST

- Title/Intro Screen

- Engine animation (particle effect?)
- Add FPSLogger and in-game physics changing / planetoid creation tools


## STEPS TAKEN

- Getting basics physics done in Box2D debug renderer mode. Planetoids and circles
for the actors.

- Created Intro screen (star splash).



* I was tweaking physics and game-play throughout.
